              Hello World! I'm Afua Deborah, a Front-End Web Developer based out
              of Toronto. From choreography on a stage to lines of code on a web
              page, I love combining the worlds of logic and creative design to
              make eye-catching, accessible, and user-friendly websites and
              applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technology leads, society follows. The move towards increasing
              inclusivity and diversity in the industry through representation
              is of importance to me.
            </p>

              I'm excited to make the leap and continue refining my skills with
              the right company. Drop me a line and/or your favourite restaurant
              in Toronto in the contact form below or check me out at:
